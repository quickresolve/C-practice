#Notes on Learning C

Learning C the hard way.


## #include <stdio.h>

# is known as compiler directive. Headerfile are the files with extension .h and they contain inbuilt functions such as printf, strlen, abs, etc. stdio.h stands for standard input output and it contains functions such as scanf, printf, gets, puts, etc.


##Makefile

make - GNU make utility to maintain groups of programs

make is a UNIX tool to simplify building program executables from many modules. make reads in rules specified as a list of target entries from a user created Makefile. make will only re-build things that need to be re-built (objects or executables that depend on files that have been modified).
