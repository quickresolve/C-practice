##Makefile

make - GNU make utility to maintain groups of programs

make is a UNIX tool to simplify building program executables from many modules. make reads in rules specified as a list of target entries from a user created Makefile. make will only re-build things that need to be re-built (objects or executables that depend on files that have been modified).
